This is a short project I made, to quickly refresh myself. 

This app is based off a code along video, made by a senior dev called Arthur.

It was broken up into 3 parts, with the first video being the longest. The first video being the longest made a lot of sense to me, since I had learned a lot big and small. I picked up on cool little tricks that made the whole experience even better as I would research & look into em. As well learn different ways to set up the functionality of an app. But the biggest thing I enjoyed was being able to see a more experienced devoloper at work, even on a simple project like this one because it showed how much different I would've approached the project compare to Arthur.
